## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Approach

### Code Structure Pattern
Following existing patterns:
```
nodes/InstantlyApi/
├── operations/
│   ├── EmailOperations.ts (NEW)
│   ├── LeadListOperations.ts (NEW)
│   └── AnalyticsOperations.ts (EXPAND)
├── parameters/
│   ├── EmailParameters.ts (NEW)
│   └── LeadListParameters.ts (NEW)
└── types/
    └── common.ts (UPDATE)
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create new operation files** following existing patterns
2. **Add parameter definitions** for new resources
3. **Update type definitions** to include new resources/operations
4. **Update OperationRouter** to handle new resources
5. **Update main node file** with new resource options
6. **Test new endpoints** thoroughly

### Quality Assurance
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Add comprehensive parameter validation
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Test all new endpoints

## 📅 Development Timeline

### Week 1: Email Management
- Create EmailOperations.ts
- Add email parameters
- Update types and router
- Test email operations

### Week 2: Lead Lists
- Create LeadListOperations.ts
- Add lead list parameters
- Integration testing

### Week 3: Enhanced Analytics
- Expand AnalyticsOperations.ts
- Add new analytics endpoints
- Performance testing

### Week 4: Email Verification & Polish
- Add email verification
- Code review and optimization
- Documentation updates

## 🔄 Branch Management Strategy

### Current Branches
- `master` - Stable production code
- `feature/instantly-webhook-trigger` - Webhook development (paused)
- `feature/api-v2-expansion` - API expansion (active)

### Workflow
1. Develop on `feature/api-v2-expansion`
2. Regular commits and pushes
3. Merge to `master` when stable
4. Resume webhook development later

### Safety Measures
- Never merge development code to master
- Regular backups of all branches
- Thorough testing before merges
- Code reviews for major changes

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- Add 15+ new API endpoints
- Maintain code quality and patterns
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage

### User Value Goals
- Enable complete email management workflows
- Provide advanced lead organization capabilities
- Enhance analytics and reporting features
- Improve overall API coverage from ~40% to ~70%

## 📝 Next Immediate Steps

1. ✅ Create development branch (DONE)
2. 🔄 Start with Email Management implementation
3. Create EmailOperations.ts file
4. Add email parameter definitions
5. Update type definitions
6. Test first email endpoint

**Ready to begin Phase 1: Email Management implementation!** 🚀
